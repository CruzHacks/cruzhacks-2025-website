#  CruzHacks 2025 Website

CruzHacks 2025 website built with React, Typescript, Tailwind, and hosted with
firebase. Website depends on firestore rules, indexes, and functions defined in
[CruzHacks 2024 backend](https://github.com/CruzHacks/cruzhacks-2024-backend).

## Getting Started

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to use a specific version of
   node; in this case, v18.18.2
   2a. run `command -v nvm` to check if nvm is installed correctly, should output `nvm`
3. Use `nvm install 18` and `nvm use 18` to use version 18 of node, you may have
   to redo this step each time you open terminal
4. Navigate to the root of the repository and run `yarn` to install all the
   dependencies
5. Find/create .env file according to .env.sample (optional: create/find
   .env.production for production environment)
6. Run `yarn start` to start the frontend

### How to Deploy

1. Install [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) to emulate
   hosting or deploy to staging. We recommend installing through npm via `npm
install -g firebase-tools`
2. Login using `firebase login`
3. Test the CLI is working properly and you have access to CruzHacks firebase
   projects using `firebase projects:list` (you may not have access to production
   for security reasons, however you need access to development to emulate:hosting
   locally)
4. Deploy to development or production using `yarn deploy:dev` or `yarn
deploy:prod`
